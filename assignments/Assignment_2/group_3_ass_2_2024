This document will record the activities of group 3.
Igor, you will advance tuple. Zuleika and I List and Katherine all string

Tuple:

tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

tuple2 = ([7, 8], [9, 1], [10, 7])

#1: Print the first item of the second item of tuple1 object. Hint: Use indexing

result = tuple1[1][0]
print(result)

#2: Print the last item of the tuple1 object. Hint: Use indexing. This is one case

print(tuple1[2])

#2: Print the last item of the tuple1 object. Hint: Use indexing. This is second case
print(tuple1[-1])

#3: Change the value "orange" for "pink grapefruit". Comment the output. Hint: Is it possible?

#Answer: it's not possible because this is a tuple and its values can not be changed.

#4: Print the length of tuple1. Hint: Length function

len(tuple1)

#5 Sum all the elements of tuple2 and describe your steps and explain each of them. Hint: Use map function

#First of all, define the function sumtup. The result will be the sum of the elements.
def sumtup (variable):
    result= map(sum, variable)
    return list(result)

new_01 = sumtup(tuple2)

#In this case we can see that when we print new_01, we can see the result of the list (sum).
print (new_01)

#In this case we can see the total of the all elements.
print(sum (new_01))

#6 Generate a new tuple object named as tuple3 with the half values of tuple2. This tuple should be similar as tuple2, tuple of lists. Hint: Use map funciont.

#In this case we use lambda because we want to write the code in a single line.
tuple2_01=list(map(lambda number: number / 2, tuple2[0]))
tuple2_02=list(map(lambda number: number / 2, tuple2[1]))
tuple2_03=list(map(lambda number: number / 2, tuple2[2]))

tuple3 = (tuple2_01, tuple2_02, tuple2_03)

print(tuple3)
